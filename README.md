# Lost Ark anti-sleep
An autohotkey to prevent you from idling

Either:
- Install AutoHotKey, double-click the file .ahk for viewing and being able to change the source OR
- Double-click the .exe-file

and press F8 to start or pause.

It's recommended that you put yourself in a safe secure location like your Stronghold (f2 + Song of Hearth and Home), stand in the open grass field before starting to use this, as you'll be doing some odd behaviour.

The script is somewhat tested, your mileage my vary.
